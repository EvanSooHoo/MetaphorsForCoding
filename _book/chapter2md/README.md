Their plane was about to crash.  Jerry said the impact would likely be in approximately eight minutes and 53.719 seconds.

[Insert literally any dialogue here]

“This plane will crash in eight minutes!” shouted Jerry, from the other side.

“We know!” Steven shouted back.  “God, that guy is such an idiot.  Anyway, where were we…right, the car problem.  Optimally park cars in lots for minimum distance.  Poorly defined inputs.  An interviewer who acted like it was a perfectly reasonable question.”

“Maybe we should deal with the crash?”

“Maybe.”
Their altitude was dangerously low.  The control console was flashing so many warnings that they could not scroll up and see all of them; they had no choice but to modify the debugging level to ERROR.

“This aircraft is about to pass through the Amazon cloud.  Looks like there’s a lot of activity.  Brace yourself.”

The plane rapidly descended into gray lightning and fog.  In those flashes, Steven caught a glimpse of operating systems that never were and never would be.
“Good.  We’re through the Amazon cloud.  On the count of three, I need you to activate the load balancer.  1…2…3!”

“Deploying!  It’s not working, though.  Aircraft is too heavy…can we drop the payload?”

“No.”

“Okay.”

“I need you to pull out all the stops.  Maintain structural integrity…deploy dispensable resources like the landing gear, fuselage bottom, and idle processes we had dedicated to mining bitcoin.”

“Done!”

“Console reporting that the left engine is on fire.  Use Task Manager to put out the fire in the left engine!”
“The left engine is dead now!”

“Yup, that’s what happens.  Easier to just kill the process than actually fix it.”

“Right engine is now on fire!”

“Talk about a bad day.  The probability of both of them failing is like 1/65536.”

“How Task Manager is on fire!”

“Use Task Manager to kill Task Manager.  Our best bet now is to land in that field over there, right next to the forest of binary trees.”

“On it.”

“As instructed,” said Roger, now talking to the box, “the value of our lives is less than the value of the aircraft.  Even if we do not survive, we will use our last moments alive to provide you with crash data, so that someone may recover this aircraft and figure out what went wrong.”

“Saving a copy of all log files now,” said Steven.

“Sending a bunch of pictures of various parts of the aircraft now,” said Roger.

“Hey, you know what would really help us right now?”

“What?”

“Solving merge sort on a whiteboard.”
