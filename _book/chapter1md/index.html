<p>Jerry was a brand new recruit in a small squadron called Corginia - they had their own J-Everything Plane, and were on a critical mission to deliver resources to Mewni, an island off the coast of Freedom Nation that served as an offensive outpost.  Their plane was rapidly descending and they doubted they would have enough fuel to get out of this alive.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What happened?&#x201D; shouted their captain, Roger.  Roger was a middle-aged man with two children and a wife whose shady background had nearly cost him his top secret clearance; in spite of this, he didn&#x2019;t look a day over 40.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Our payload is too heavy,&#x201D; said Steven.  &#x201C;Someone at the load balance station must have screwed up!&#x201D;  Steven was another new recruit, and he was an ass.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do we do?&#x201D; Jerry asked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re way too low right now,&#x201D; Steven replied.  &#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to have to find a way to scale up, vertically.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Maybe we need more RAM?&#x201D; asked Jerry.  RAM was an airplane term for fuel - it stood for Refueling Airplane Material.  The more they had, the faster and higher they could go.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Great idea, Jerry.  Go to the engine, press the button to download more RAM, and report back.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;On it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Get back here!  I was kidding, you can&#x2019;t download RAM.  You&#x2019;re such an idiot, Jerry!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Okay, what do you want me to do?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Go to the control station and call for help.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jerry walked to the airfone, but couldn&#x2019;t remember what number he was supposed to call.  He checked the directory hung on the board and called the first number it had listed - 127.0.0.1.  To his amazement, a connection was established.  When he tried to talk, though, all he heard was his own voice playing back.
Jerry ran back to the cockpit.
&#x201C;I couldn&#x2019;t contact anyone!&#x201D; he said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What number did you try to call?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;127.0.0.1.&#x201D;
Steven and the captain exchanged glances.  &#x201C;Jerry, you&#x2019;re a dumb ass.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Steven ran to the control station.  Jerry remained in the cockpit.  One may have expected that these two things were in the same place, but a top-level decision to modify their communication protocol meant it required quite a bit of wiring just to establish connections to their other units.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Welp,&#x201D; said the captain, &#x201C;this is it.  We&#x2019;re going to die.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t we just drop part of the payload?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unacceptable.  Better to crash.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is it really better to die than drop part of our payload?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been an honor serving beside you, sir.&#x201D;
&#x201C;The feeling is not mutual.&#x201D;</p>
